Ed Conroy's Quake IV Mod
============================
Team Oddball

You need to play CTF and set the max score to 150.
Players cannot capture the enemy flag but the longer they
hold onto the flag the more points they get.  Once a team score reaches
150 the team wins.

Armor Mod

Armor now has a set amount of damage it takes each time (3 per hit).  Armor
also defends against fall damage and all other kinds of damage

Weapon Mods

1) Rocket Launcher turned into the Tri Mini-Nuke, respawn data changed to be
more infrequent
2) Hyberblaster reverted to Rocket Rifle, damage modified to simulate a machine
rocket launcher
3) Nailgun converted into the Machine Grenade Launcher
4) Gauntlet converted to Chainsaw
5) Lightning gun damage and knockback buff
6) Machinegun damage buff
7) Shotgun knockback buff
8) Railgun damage buff

Damage and knockback buffs added to weapons with hitscans to create a unique feel
for the gun and to provide each gun with a different situational use.  Damage buffs 
and fire rate buffs used to offset the temporary invulnarbility that the armor affords the
player.
